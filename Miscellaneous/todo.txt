Top priority:
-check for late binding


Secondary priority:
-should rawreferences really be gridreferences?
-array formula/operator support
-3D references
-test invalid formulas
-handle circular references with dynamic references
-implement non-grid source references

Done:
-add/subtract number from date
-expose named ref result
-expose recalculate for variable
-implement reference list
-make errorvaluewrapper serializable
-code serialization test
-implement grammar types
-make parser non-static

Notes:
-need reference valid field otherwise all references created on-the-fly will be invalid!
-can't range link to range because that makes all ranges non-sources!
